# Rust Concepts

### Structs

**A struct, or structure, is a custom data type that lets you name and package together multiple related values that make up a meaningful group.**

A simple struct:

```rust
// Struct
struct User {
    username: String,
    email: String,
    sign_in_count: u64,
    pub active: bool,
}

// Immutable instance
let ameer =  User {
    username: String::from("ameer"),
    email: String::from("ameernormie@gmail.com"),
    sign_in_count: 1,
    pub active: true,
}

// Mutable instance
let mut ameer =  User {
    username: String::from("ameer"),
    email: String::from("ameernormie@gmail.com"),
    sign_in_count: 1,
    pub active: true,
}

ameer.username = String::from("ameernormie");
```

##### Create instances from other instances

It’s often useful to create a new instance of a struct that uses most of an old instance’s values but changes some. You’ll do this using struct update syntax.

###### Without update syntax

```rust
let user2 = User {
    email: String::from("another@example.com"),
    username: String::from("anotherusername567"),
    active: user1.active,
    sign_in_count: user1.sign_in_count,
};
```

###### With update syntax

```rust
let user2 = User {
    email: String::from("another@example.com"),
    username: String::from("anotherusername567"),
    ..user1
};
```

##### Tuple Structs

They are similar to `tuples`. They have the added meaning the struct name provides but don't have names associated with them; rather they just have the types of fields.
`They are useful when you want to give the whole tuple a name and differentiate them from normal tuples`

```rust
struct Color(i32, i32, i32);
struct Point(i32, i32, i32);

let black = Color(0, 0, 0);
let origin = Point(0, 0, 0);
```

A gotcha:
`In above example,`black`and`origin`are not of the same type. Each struct you define is its own type, even though the fields within the struct have the same types.`

##### Unit like Structs without any fields

You can also define structs that don’t have any fields! These are called unit-like structs because they behave similarly to (), the unit type. Unit-like structs can be useful in situations in which you need to implement a trait on some type but don’t have any data that you want to store in the type itself.

##### Ownership of Struct Data

It’s possible for structs to store references to data owned by something else, but to do so requires the use of lifetimes, a Rust feature that we’ll discuss later.Lifetimes ensure that the data referenced by a struct is valid for as long as the struct is. Let’s say you try to store a reference in a struct without specifying lifetimes, like this, which won’t work:

```rust
struct User {
    username: &str,
    email: &str,
    sign_in_count: u64,
    active: bool,
}

fn main() {
    let user1 = User {
        email: "someone@example.com",
        username: "someusername123",
        active: true,
        sign_in_count: 1,
    };
}
```
